Android Technical Assessment
---

This is a mobile client for a mock elections system which could show results pages similar to how BBC News covers elections. 
**Note:** If you are not familiar with how elections work in the UK, please see this short BBC video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRxUhGetEPQ


## Setup

Requires:

- Android Studio Chipmunk or higher
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) or Teams for screensharing

Notes:

- In this directory there is a single Android project containing two separate application modules, `appWithComposeUI` and `appWithXmlUI`. **You must choose whether to use Jetpack Compose or XML layouts, and use the appropriate module to complete the assessment.**
- The project also includes an `api` module containing shared code used by both targets. As part of completing the tasks, you may make changes inside this module if you wish.
- All targets also include unit tests, which can be run by selecting the correct folder in the project hierarchy menu, right clicking and choosing _'Run Tests in...'_.

**Please verify that you can open the project in Android Studio, build the application, and run the unit tests in advance of your booked assessment time.**

## Assessment Time: 3 Days

## Assessment Process

In the assessment process, after making changes in your github repository, we will ask you to share your working environment and talk through the following with us in a recorded video (shared via youtube link (uploaded as 'PRIVATE and reachable only via link' may be):

- What does this system do? What are its key features?
- New Feature requests! - The election product team have some feature requests that we would like you to take a look at. They can be found in `Tasks.md`.
- Please create a github repository of your own and share your assignment as a repository, detail the code changes in readme file and share the youtube link within readme.
