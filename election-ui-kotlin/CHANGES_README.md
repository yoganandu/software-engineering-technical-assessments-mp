I have made the following changes

1. API - To return the candidate name to be displayed on the screen
2. Added new AndroidViewModel to check the accessibility and to monitor network status
3. Made the appropriate UI changes to cater the new feature requestes
4. Improved the behavious when the accessibility is turned on
5. I am not aware of the TouchTarget or the WCAG standard as a general practice I have added the required padding which might address this to some extent
